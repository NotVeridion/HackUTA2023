# HackUTA2023

This project for HackUTA 2023 is a E-Commerce website meant to display good deals from retailers and distributors like Amazon, Ebay, Adidas, Nike, and more. 

Though incomplete, we have managed to get a website running that can webscrape from Ebay for information like prices, links to the items, item names, and item images to be published on our site. With enough time, we would've been able to implement a filtering system for the prices so that users can grab the lowest prices possible. Something we want to improve on is our webscraping script. This was our first time writing a webscraper and it was hard to connect the back-end webscraper to the front-end visuals. If possible, we'd like to expand our project to scrape data from multiple websites, not just Ebay.
